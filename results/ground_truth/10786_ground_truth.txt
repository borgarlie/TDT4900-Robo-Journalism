but captive animals can get foot problems if their toenails are n't trimmed .
researcher from the university of queensland , australia , has developed a pressure pad to measure the pressure exerted on elephants ' feet .
data could inform the best way to trim toenails and allow zookeepers to spot potential foot problems , which can lead to elephants being put down .
