derek mitchell of kansas city decided his life needed to change 5 years ago after he was told a tumor had contributed to his 625-pound frame .
now 570 pounds , mitchell has turned to running in a bid to get himself fit after fears set in that he 'd have no future unless he changed his ways .
` if i can walk a 5k , anyone can , and i 'm living proof of that now , ' he said earlier this month as he 'd switched to vegan options and a more active life .
