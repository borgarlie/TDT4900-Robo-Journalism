peter boddy sold 55 horse carcasses without keeping record of the sales .
abattoir boss from yorkshire claimed 37 were sold to italian restaurants .
but food standards agency investigators could not back up his claims .
he was found guilty of failing to produce proper paperwork for carcasses .
there is no proof to suggest boddy tried to pass off horsemeat as beef .
it is impossible to know where meat ended up because rules were broken .
he and a colleague are the first involved in 2013 scandal to be sentenced .
