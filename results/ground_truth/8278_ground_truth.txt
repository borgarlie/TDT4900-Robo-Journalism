supernova could be seen because its light took different paths .
this allowed astronomers to take four images of the ancient star .
a massive galaxy cluster warped the light as it travelled to earth .
einstein predicted this would happen in his theory which explains how objects bend space-time to create what we experience as gravity .
images could help explain dark matter behaviour in nearby cluster .
light from the supernova is expected to reappear the next few years .
