manchester city manager manuel pellegrini has admitted for the first time he could be sacked if he finishes outside the champions league places this season .
pellegrini 's side face west ham united at the etihad stadium on sunday with their top four prospects hanging in the balance .
the premier league champions have lost four of their last five games and pellegrini said : ` you are wrong if you think that , at this club , you are out if you do n't win the title .
the club are not guaranteeing the manager will survive but it does not appear they have already made up their mind to borussia dortmund manager jurgen klopp two years ago .
