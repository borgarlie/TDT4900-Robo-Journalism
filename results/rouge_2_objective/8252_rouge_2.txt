gunners have experienced contrasting fortunes on the pitch in recent weeks but danny welbeck and several of the liverpool squad appear to share a mutual fondness for nicki minaj .
the gunners forward was spotted arriving at the manchester arena on monday night to watch the pop star perform , two days after his side thrashed the reds 4-1 at the emirates .
liverpool full back jose enrique was also in attendance at the concert along with team-mates alberto moreno and mamadou sakho .
