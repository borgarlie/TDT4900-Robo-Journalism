muhammadu buhari , who won the presidential election two weeks ago , said his administration would do everything in their power to bring the students home - but said he could not promise they would find them .
the announcement came as a march was held through the nigerian capital of abuja to mark the first anniversary since the girls were abducted from a secondary school in chibok .
protestors marched through abuja with red tape over their mouths , carrying a poster with pictures of some of the missing girls .
