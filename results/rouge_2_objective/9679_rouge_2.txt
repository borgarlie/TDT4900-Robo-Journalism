pictures were posted on twitter by a member of the anti-isis campaign group raqqa is being slaughtered silently who risk their lives every day by documenting atrocities from inside the city .
in scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps , scores of downtrodden syrians wait in line for hours for food in the islamic state 's self-declared capital of raqqa .
the pictures are a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity that terror group 's slick pr machine would like the world to believe .
