a french bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for roma passengers - because the ` unbearable ' smell is a health risk to everyone on board .
dominique granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of montpellier , in the south of france .
but while his comments were immediately met with horror by some , the bus company tam has taken his comments seriously and is said to have ` outsourced ' part of the route .
odour : the smell on route 9 in montpellier is said to be ` unbearable ' and caused by roma using the service .
bus driver mr granier said the smell which accompanied the roma was a ` sanitation risk ' in an interview last week .
speaking to the gazette de montpelier mr granier said : ` it is a true infection .
' his claims were backed up by other drivers , one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour .
bernard gotis , a local union representative , was disgusted by the comments .
` we should not tackle the poor , but poverty ... we do not want to recreate apartheid in montpellier , ' he said .
apartheid : some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp .

however , mr gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion , and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell .
he told french newspaper libération : ` our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with roma and to outsource this portion of line .
