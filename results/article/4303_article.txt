labour candidate tulip siddiq -lrb- left -rrb- was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- in moscow two years ago .
but the tories last night accused ms siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to putin and sheikh hasina .
they claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in january 2013 -- just six months before she won a hotly-contested labour selection contest in hampstead -- and her links with hasina .
the tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected .
and they questioned why her 1,200-word official labour profile made no mention of putin , the arms deal or being a member of a ruling bangladeshi dynasty .
a tory official said : ` it seems very odd that ms siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life .
' retiring labour mp glenda jackson won hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010 .
last night a labour spokesman said : ` tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it .
' as for the photograph , the spokesman said : ` tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family .
