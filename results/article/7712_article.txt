british no 2 aljaz bedene was unable to sustain his strong run since switching allegiance from slovenia , crashing out of the grand prix hassan ii in casablanca in the last eight .
the world no 99 had breezed past fellow-qualifier arthur de greef of belgium in a 70-minute , straight-sets victory to set up his quarter-final clash - but was unable to dislodge czech young gun jiri vesely on friday .
vesely saw off bedene 6-1 6-4 to reach the final four and tee up a clash with spanish veteran daniel gimeno-traver .
aljaz bedene , who has switched from slovenia to great britain , lost in casablanca -lrb- not pictured -rrb- .
the 21-year-old rising czech star put paid to bedene 's good start to life under the official british banner , after the london-based 25-year-old changed nationality last month .
vesely saw off mikhail youzhny on thursday despite all his luggage being lost in transit from rome and borrowing kit from doubles partner frantisek cermak .
that victory ended a seven-match losing streak , and he continued his resurgence to sweep past bedene without issue .
bedene 's conqueror jiri vesely of the czech republic will play gimeno-traver in the semi-finals .
vesely 's next opponent gimeno-traver dropped just six points on his first serve in a 6-4 6-3 victory over lamine ouahab .
second seed martin klizan saw off nicolas almagro 6-4 7-6 -lrb- 6/3 -rrb- , meanwhile , denying his spanish opponent a 250th career win on clay .
klizan will face damir dzumhur next after the bosnian eased past sixth seed andreas haider-maurer 6-3 6-3 .
