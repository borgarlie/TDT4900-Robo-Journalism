a geese tsunami was the colourful description given by a canadian cameraman after he filmed an extraordinary natural sight in richmond , canada .
maikel parets was filming thousands of birds who had landed on a baseball field to take a break just south of vancouver in british columbia during their annual migration .
the sea of geese was impressive enough , but then they took off - those at the back went first with the others following as if they had choreographed their departure to look like a giant wave .

resting : a giant gaggle of geese rest on a baseball field in richmond , canada , before a spectacular take-off .
stirring : some further geese join the group from overhead as the geese start to move before departure .
parets repeatedly says ` oh my god ' as the geese begin the next phase of their journey by speeding directly at him before spectacularly flying over his head , with every moment captured .
while parets marvelled at the sight , one woman at the end of his video is seen checking her hair for an unfortunate deposit from one of the birds .
mr parets said : ' i was spared and not even one of their poop touched me but the lady at the end of the video was not that lucky .
' varri raffan , of the george c. reifel migratory bird sanctuary , told global news he was not surprised to see the large gaggle of geese travelling together as they are known to ` stick together ' .
take-off : suddenly the geese at the back take flight before those in front follow , creating a tsunami effect .
spectacular : the thousands of geese continue their migration south from richmond , canada .
raffan said geese are very family oriented , particularly remaining in large groups for migration and feeding purposes .
he said the area where the geese landed could accommodate up to 70,000 geese .
