aviva premiership club gloucester will face a rugby football union hearing after selecting lock mariano galarza for their league game against sale sharks last month .
the rfu has said galarza should have been ineligible for the match .
in a statement , the rfu said : ` in the aviva premiership rugby match against sale sharks on march 29 , gloucester rugby breached aviva premiership rugby regulation 3.3 -lrb- a -rrb- by selecting a player -lrb- mariano galarza -rrb- who did not hold effective registration for gloucester rugby .
mariano galarza played for gloucester against sale sharks despite the fact that he 's ineligible .
` the case will be heard by an independent panel of jeremy summers , bonike erinle and robert horner on monday , april 27 .
' galarza was selected among gloucester 's replacements for a game that they lost 23-6 at the a j bell stadium .
he went on as a 54th-minute substitute for tom savage .
gloucester currently lie ninth in the aviva premiership , and it is feasible that they could be hit by a points deduction .
the west country club have three league games left - against newcastle , london irish and bath - while they are also through to next week 's european challenge cup final , when they will face edinburgh at the twickenham stoop .
the aviva premiership side now face the prospect of having points deducted for the misdemeanour .
