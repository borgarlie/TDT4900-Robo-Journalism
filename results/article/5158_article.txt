a farmer from eastern china has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs .
the 20-day-old ` spider goat ' - as it has been -lrb- inaccurately -rrb- nicknamed by chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs .
xiao qibin , owner of the farm , said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with ` an extraordinary appetite ' , the people 's daily online reports .
rare : this six-legged kid has become a star animal in china since it was born 20 days ago .
mr xiao started running his goat farm in chaohu in anhui province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats .
` during the labour , i saw the nanny goat was having difficulty , ' said mr xiao .
' i saw two legs came out at first , but surprisingly another four followed when the kid was fully born , ' he added .
mr xiao said at first he was n't sure if the mutant goat - which weighed 5kg at birth - would survive .
however , the kid is healthy and growing quickly - and has become one of the most playful goats on the farm .
` he can eat a lot , ' added the farmer .
playful : miss ge , an employee at xiao qibin 's farm , takes care of the playful baby goat every day .
the kid 's six legs were of similar length initially , but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground .
mr xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal ` lake goats ' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation .
he said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs .
' i want him to grow up naturally and happily , ' said mr xiao .
healthy : mr xiao said the goat is growing quickly and has become one of the most playful animals on the farm .
