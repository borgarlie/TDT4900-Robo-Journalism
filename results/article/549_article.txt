the ` say it with nutella ' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread , which they could then share with friends on social media .

the nutella website says : ` here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love .
' but users realised that there is a long list of words banned , which bizarrely does not allow ` lesbian ' but permits the word ` gay ' .
the word ` christian ' can also be written on the jars , but other religious terms such as ` jewish ' and ` muslim ' have been banned by nutella , pink news reported .
the ` say it with nutella ' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread .
health-related terms , presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity , have also been banned , including the words ` cancer ' and ` diabetes ' .
the company , owned by ferrero , has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil , the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans .
this may explain why ` boycott ' and ` orangutan ' make the long list of banned words .
ferrero said in a statement : ` by giving customers the opportunity to personalise their nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand .
` negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field .
similarly , terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities .
' the news comes just a day after it emerged that marks & spencer had banned the words ` christ ' and ` jesus christ ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers
