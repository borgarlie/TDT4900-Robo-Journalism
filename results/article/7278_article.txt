if you are wanting to explore a city , get to a meeting in a hurry , visit a friend , or just get home after a night of cocktails , there is nothing better than a good taxi service to make it happen .
ever since motorised travel first came into use in the 19th century people with knowledge of the roads and attractions have charged willing passengers for their services .
despite all the different types of transportation , be it a cab , tup tup , jeepney or jitney , we are all bound and aided by a common service : the humble taxi .
as of march 14 , 2014 , in new york city , there are 51,398 men and women licensed to drive yellow taxicabs .
with the first taxi carriage services starting to emerge in 1897 , transportation was often rickety , slow and motorless , with both driver and passenger unsure of the correct fare price .
the boom of industry in the 19th century resulted in motorised methods replacing animal taxis , although this is still common in areas of the world where vehicles would be impractical .
these include husky-propelled sledges , camels in the sahara or elephant rides in asia .
even the prices vary dramatically , with haggling being common place in peru , and taxi-sharing being popular in nigeria .
fares can be calculated per mile , with some of the most expensive being london 's hackney carriage cabs at # 2.56 , compared to # 0.30 per mile in india 's equivalent .
