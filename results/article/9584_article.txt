german shepherds were bred specifically for their high levels of intelligence and as a result are commonly used as police and guard dogs around the world .
however their desire to learn , which clearly overpowers their desire to just accept what is , can sometimes lead them to become a source of amusement , as this dog 's owner recently found out .
filmed in a garden , the german shepherd named sonja stares down at its shadow being cast on the floor before giving its owner and his friends a laugh .
the dog initially stares down at its shadow being cast onto the patio before making an attempt to paw at it .
wagging its tail , the dog initially seems to try and lose its shadow by hopping around and making a sharp turn .
as it gets back to its original position it realises that the shadow is still there , and it stamps on it with its left paw .
suddenly the german shepherd leaps into the air and jumps down onto the shadow , before hopping three more times in quick succession .
attempting to lose the shadow , the dog jumps up into the air and lands back down onto it below .
the german shepherd called sonja later jumps onto the shadow three more times in quick succession .
the people standing around watching can be heard laughing and one of them notes : ` he 's playing with the shadow .
he sees the shadow .
' the dog then circles its shadow once more , as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action -- its tongue sticks out in concentration .
before leaping into the air -- leaving the ground with all four legs -- and landing back down onto it several more times .
the dog circles its shadow , as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action , before jumping on it .
the people watching can be heard laughing as the german shepherd attempts to lose its shadow .
the video concludes with the dog eventually losing its shadow by moving out of the sun and into the shade .
