cesar azpilicueta may be chelsea 's mr reliable but it 's doubtful blues boss jose mourinho will be seeking his advice on team selection if his five-a-side line-up is anything to go by .
the defender nicknamed ` dave ' was asked to select from his favourite team-mates and the 25-year-old spaniard went out of left field by picking two goalkeepers , petr cech and thibaut courtois , and arsenal 's nacho monreal as his only defender .
chelsea boss jose mourinho is unlikely to be talking tactics with cesar azpilicueta .
but azpilicueta made up for his unorthodox defence by selecting eden hazard in midfield and diego costa as his striker .
` firstly , i apologise to any of my old team-mates if i missed you out , but it was so hard just picking five , ' azpilicueta told the chelsea website .
azpilicueta picked an unorthodox five-a-side team with two goalkeepers including petr cech .
azpilicueta 's side would be hard to score against with cech and thibaut courtois between the sticks .
` i 've played with some great goalkeepers .
i do n't know , there are too many to choose from !
` can i pick two goalkeepers ?
well , it is my team !
i 'm going for petr and thibaut .
' arsenal 's nacho monreal would have his hands full as the only defender in the five-a-side team .
at least the attacking options looked good with chelsea 's eden hazard as the midfielder .
chelsea striker diego costa would link up in attack with hazard in azpilicueta 's side .
` i 'm not going to pick myself , so the defender in my side is going to be nacho monreal from arsenal .
he is my good friend , we know each other from osasuna and he is a good competitor .
` my first attacking player is eden hazard .
it 's for obvious reasons .
' ` my striker will be diego costa .
i know he 's going to compete , be strong .
i think we are going to have a good team with these players .
