british hope kyle edmund failed to take advantage of his wildcard entry when he was swept out of the miami open first round .
the 20-year-old from yorkshire was beaten 6-2 6-2 in just 68 minutes by holland 's robin haase , the world number 98 .
edmund reached the semi-final in a strong challenger field in texas last week but could not replicate that form .
kyle edmund returns a shot during his first round miami open match with holland 's robin haase .
world number 98 haase only needed 68 minutes to defeat edmund 6-2 , 6-2 .
haase can be inconsistent but this was one of his better days and the british number three has no answers .
he may have been better off trying to come through the qualifying rather than getting a privileged entry through his management company img , who own the tournament .
edmund finds the going tough as he struggles to deal with the challenge of haase in miami .
