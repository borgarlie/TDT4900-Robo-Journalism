aston villa take on liverpool in their fa cup semi-final encounter on sunday with the competition both sides ' last chance to win any silverware this season .
sportsmail columnist jamie redknapp looks ahead to the wembley showdown and where the match could be won and lost with individual player duels .
christian benteke v martin skrtel .
this will be a heavyweight contest that could decide the game .
christian benteke is superb in the air and martin skrtel will have his hands full .
liverpool have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their achilles heel this season .
christian benteke -lrb- centre -rrb- scored the only goal of the game as villa won 1-0 at tottenham on april 11 .
liverpool defender martin skrtel -lrb- right -rrb- will have his hands full trying to stop benteke on sunday afternoon .
fabian delph v jordan henderson .
this should be a good contest between two england team-mates .
fabian delph 's new deal was a real boost for villa - he drives that midfield , though he does n't get enough goals .
you used to say the same about jordan henderson but he has improved so much .
england international fabian delph -lrb- left -rrb- and jordan henderson are set for a midfield battle at wembley .
raheem sterling v ron vlaar and nathan baker .
ron vlaar and nathan baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a benteke than a raheem sterling , who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them .
raheem sterling 's -lrb- left -rrb- pace and trickery is bound to cause the villa defence a lot of problems .
ron vlaar -lrb- left -rrb- was part of the villa defence that kept a clean sheet at spurs in the premier league .
the holland international and nathan baker -lrb- right -rrb- will be hoping to do likewise against the reds at wembley .
