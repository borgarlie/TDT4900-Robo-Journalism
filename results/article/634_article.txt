baristas whose tips were robbed from the counter have decided to save the thief a run-in with police and in true christmas spirit , organize a food drive for him instead .
staff at the nervous dog coffee bar in stow , ohio , announced they would hold a food-drive for the man this week rather than file a police report against him .
surveillance footage from the store shows the stranger order a coffee from a young barista , then when her back is turned , dip his hand into the tip jar and stuff as much cash as possible into his pocket .

a thief dips his hand into the baristas ' tip jar while the server 's back is turned at the nervous dog coffee bar in stow , ohio .
the man grabs dollars and stuffs them deep into his pocket while the barista has her back turned pouring his coffee .
however the kindhearted staff decided the desperate man needed their compassion instead of a visit from the police .
the coffee shop posted the surveillance tape on its facebook page , with the words : ` we figured anyone desperate enough to steal a few bucks from a kid working her way through college , is likely pretty hungry .
` if anyone is able to help us find this unfortunate man , we will make the donations available to him christmas week .
` we will also provide him with free brewed coffee for the remainder of this year .
if he is unable to get to the shop again in order to pick up the food , we are happy to drop it off if anyone can help us locate the hungry fellow .
