liverpool midfielder adam lallana has pulled out of the england squad to face lithuania and italy .
the squad are due to meet at st george 's park at lunchtime , but it is understood lallana will not be among them .
the midfielder 's groin injury flared up in the 2-1 defeat to manchester united on sunday and he will therefore miss the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday and england 's friendly in italy four days later .
adam lallana -lrb- right -rrb- has withdrawn from the england squad after suffering a groin injury for liverpool .
lallana was taken off at half-time and replaced by steven gerrard who was sent off after 38 seconds .
england manager roy hodgson will be hoping to make it five wins from five in euro 2016 qualifying .
lallana came off at half-time during the loss to louis van gaal 's side .
the player is understood to believe the injury is not too serious .
the rest of the now 23-man england party is due to meet in burton on monday afternoon and will be assessed to see whether there will be any more withdrawals .
england will be looking to make it five qualifying wins from five on friday night before they head to turin for a friendly against the nation that beat them in their world cup opener last summer .
it is understood friday 's match against lithuania at wembley is a 90,000 sell-out .
