not everyone should be behind the wheel of a $ 50,000 car .
that 's one lesson to take away from a video posted by youtube user richard stewart showing a porsche cayman flying out of control as it speeds from a green light on prince edward island in canada .
the sports car swerves wildly before smashing into the concrete median .
a wheel even comes off before the car finally comes to a halt .
` just cause you have a nice car does n't make you a good driver .
do n't let your son drive your porsche !
'' wrote stewart on youtube about the crash .
khou reports that police have not made the identity of the driver public but have said that a 31-year-old driver was cited for the crash , leaving the car a totaled as it was towed away .
the footage begins with the porsche idling at a green light .
the car booms ahead at a dangerous speed .
almost immediately the driver begins to lose control .
the unidentified man verse wildly across the dividing line .
the car is twisting at such dangerous speeds a wheel comes loose .
finally the car comes to a halt , a total wreck waiting for the tow truck .
