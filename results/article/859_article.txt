a russian beauty has advertised for a man to get her pregnant - because she was fed up with her mother nagging her about not having grandchildren .
elena komleva , from cheliabinsk in southern russia , placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers .
the 29-year-old toe-nail painting artist described it as a ` contest ' adding that her mother would select the winning candidate .
taking to her vkontakt page - the equivalent of a facebook profile - she wrote : ` my mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting .
but nobody wants to marry me yet .
` so , if you are young , strong and healthy drop me a line .
` my mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner .
she knows what i need .
' she has already been inundated with offers from men , with many posting replies to her advert .
yuri yuriev , 28 , said : ` hmm , a woman in need - i am here to help .
' kuzma tretiakov , 25 , said : ` i 'm young , strong and healthy and ready to go .
' but while her vkontakt friends offered support and congratulations on her idea - with friend sergey mironov and others posting ` happy birthday , all the best and good luck to you ' - some were more concerned .
borislav baranov , 28 , said : ` i 'd love to help her , but her mother seems a bit of a nightmare .
' and leonid ponomaryov said : ` what about morals ?
can this be right ?
' komleva , from cheliabinsk in southern russia , placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers .
in response ms komleva is reported as having said : ` there is nothing for me to be ashamed of .
i was in love once , but i was also unhappy .
' i am hoping to find a husband , but if i only find a biological father that 's also ok .
at least it will stop my mum going on
