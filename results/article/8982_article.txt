jordan henderson is not ready to give up on liverpool 's champions league hopes despite an eight-point gap to manchester united in fourth place .
the 24-year-old scored a penalty at the emirates on saturday , but it was not enough as liverpool fell to a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of arsenal to leave their top-four hopes in tatters .
that result followed a devastating 2-1 home defeat by manchester united last time out and brendan rodgers ' side have fallen from two points off champions league qualification to eight behind .
jordan henderson urged liverpool not to give up on their hopes of finishing in the top four .
henderson is targeting seven wins out of seven in the league and an immediate response at blackburn .
but henderson urged his team not to give up on the top-four race with seven games to play , and to bounce back immediately on wednesday night when they take on blackburn in an fa cup quarter-final replay .
he told liverpool 's official website : ` we knew it was going to be difficult -lsb- to finish in the top four -rsb- , even before saturday , but it makes it even more difficult .
` that does n't mean we 'll just give up .
we 've got seven games left now and we need to try to win every one .
if we do that , then you never know .
` blackburn is another big game for us straight away .
we 've got to recover well , learn from this one and move on and try to get a big win on wednesday .
