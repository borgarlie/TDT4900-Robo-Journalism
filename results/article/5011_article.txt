a valet parking attendant managed to plough a 200mph supercar through the front of a shop after mistaking the brake for the throttle in a ferrari 599 gto worth # 300,000 .
the dutch owner of the 2012 supercar was waiting in the hotel exedra after attending a meeting of the ferrari owner 's club with his wife in anzio , south of rome .
the car 's owner entrusted the car , which is one of the most powerful ever produced by ferrari , to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner .

parking attendant roberto cinti was driving the ferrari , pictured , when he mistook the throttle for the brake .
the # 300,000 supercar can hit 60mph in just 3.3 seconds and ploughed through the shop front .
however , instead of pressing the brake when approaching a shop front , the driver mashed the throttle , unleashing 671bhp from the magnificent 6.0-litre v12 engine , which ordinarily could propel the car to 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds .
the corriere della sera said that the driver , roberto cinti , 38 , told police following the accident : ' i got confused .
instead of the brake , i pressed down on the accelerator .
' he blamed the car 's semi-automatic transmission for bamboozling him .
the identity of the car 's owner is not known , although insurance investigators are believed to be looking into the cause of the crash .
only three ferraris have been designated gto and only 599 of the latest model were produced .
such is the exclusivity of the 599 gto , that owners could not simply arrive at their local ferrari dealership seeking to purchase the model .
instead , they had to be invited by the italian company to hand over their cash .
only 599 of the ferrari 599 gto model were built , which is the manufacturer 's fastest ever road car .
