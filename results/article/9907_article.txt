and holly proffitt , employer relations coordinator in the career services office at arkansas state university , confirmed gardner 's observations .
` we ca n't graduate enough engineers , ' she said .
despite the recent news , in a survey of employers last fall by michigan state university , the employment center found that hiring of graduates will rise 16per cent this year .
indeed , the consulting and accounting firm ey is aggressively recruiting on college campuses this spring .
it plans to hire 9,000 graduates from u.s. universities this year , up from 7,500 in 2014 .
the overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 per cent in march from 6.7 per cent at the end of 2013 .
apparently employers have more openings to fill because baby boomers are retiring and more workers are feeling confident enough about the economy to switch jobs .
overall , the united states generated 3.1 million jobs last year , the most since 1999 .
in particular , employer demand for so-called stem graduates - in science , technology , engineering and mathematics - was highest .
offering hope to non-stem students , gardner said of the future job market : ` there seems to be a lot of room for everybody ... even arts and humanities are making a comeback .
