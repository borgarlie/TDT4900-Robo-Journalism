a melbourne man has posted an advertisement for a haunted chair on ebay .
andre williams from croydon in melbourne picked up the wicker chair from hard rubbish two years ago and is hoping to sell it for $ 666 .
in the ebay advertisement , he describes the chair as a ` vintage 1900s cane chair haunted by -lsb- a -rsb- poltergeist ' .
a chair that is ` haunted by a poltergeist ' has been advertised for sale on ebay by a melbourne seller .
` after a week of having it in the house , i heard some crying during the night -lrb- i thought i was dreaming -rrb- , ' he writes in the item description .
` then in the morning i noticed that the chair was on its side .
i did n't connect the dots until it happened several times over two years .
` sometimes there is laughing accompanied by tapping noises ... the chair is always in a different spot afterwards -lrb- moves up to three metres -rrb- leaving shallow dent marks across the floor .
' the advertisement also said the chair had ` severe scratch marks ' on the arms ` like someone has been aggressively dragging their fingernails ' .
mr williams wrote that some repair work had been done on the piece , but it was not fully restored because he was ` too afraid to touch the chair ' .
the seller wrote on the item description that he frequently found the chair on its side after hearing crying and tapping .
bidding for the chair starts at $ 25 and the buy-it-now price is $ 666 .
' i would be glad to get rid of it and pass it on to someone who has had experience with this kind of thing .
please help !!! ' the opening bid for the chair is set at $ 25 , though a keen purchaser can buy it now for $ 666 .
as yet there have been no bids placed on the item , but 16 people are watching it and the advertisement gets more than 100 views a day .
mr williams , who is an artist , told daily mail australia that the advertisement ` was meant to be a bit of theatre ' .
` people get so caught up in -lsb- supernatural
