bayern munich boss pep guardiola is keen to continue his relationship with the club after insisting he is not waiting for any offers from elsewhere .
guardiola took charge of the german powerhouses in june 2013 and has led them to success in the bundesliga and in domestic and european cup competition .
his time has been dogged by speculation over swapping leagues , most notably to england and to names like manchester city , with his current bayern deal set to run out in 2016 .
bayern munich boss pep guardiola has distanced himself from moving to manchester city in the summer .
however , ahead of his side 's dfb-pokal game against eintracht braunschweig , the former barcelona boss told a press conference : ` of course i 'll stay here .
i have n't had a contract offer and i am not waiting for a contract offer from anyone else .
` i 'm happy here at bayern , my only idea right now is to stay and work for this club here .
' i can stay in this club five or six years even .
this also depends on the players .
i 'm not the most important thing for the club .
' bayern are currently eight points clear at the top of bundesliga and their current form is formidable .
