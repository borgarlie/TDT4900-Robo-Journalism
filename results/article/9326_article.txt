lancashire 's liam livingstone scored a reported world-record 350 for nantwich town in a national club championship match against caldy on sunday .
the 21-year-old all-rounder , who has yet to make his first-team debut for the red rose , plundered 34 fours and 27 sixes in his remarkable 138-ball innings .
lancashire believes the innings is the highest-ever individual score in a one-day match .
achievement : livingstone came in at number 3 and smashed a triple-century as the scoreboard shows .
lancashire 's liam livingstone hit 350 for mantwich town against caldy in what could be a world record .
he told bbc sport : ` from 100 onwards , i was just trying to whack every ball for six .
` when i got into the high 200s and into the 300s , i realised that something quite special could happen .
' ` well done to @liaml4893 who , we think , has smashed a new world record for limited overs cricket , hitting 350 today , ' lancashire posted on their official twitter feed .
livingstone 's efforts helped nantwich to compile 579 for seven from their 45 overs .
and their efforts appeared to be wasted when they skittled caldy for just 79 to secure a staggering 500-run victory .
livingstone , who hit 204 in a second xi game against yorkshire in september , surpasses the previous record of 334 not out scored by nikhilesh surendran in hyderabad in 2008 .
