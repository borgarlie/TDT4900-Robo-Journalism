each unique to mountains in thailand , the carnivorous creatures live in rock crevices , feeding on tinier snails , insect larvae and some earthworms species .

they are at risk from extinction as their limestone habitat is destroyed by humans .
they are among three new species from the genus perrottetia , discovered in north and northeastern thailand .
the .
species show extraordinary endemism , meaning they are unique to a .
geographical area .
researchers say this ` one hill one species ' is a very peculiar phenomenon .
each one of these snails is specific and the only one inhabiting a certain mountain range .
limestone ecosystems in the world are .
now diminishing at an alarming rate as they are quarried for the stone , meaning areas like thailand are losing .
