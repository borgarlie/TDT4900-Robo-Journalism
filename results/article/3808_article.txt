this echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off rye beach , a popular surfing and fishing spot on victoria 's mornington peninsula .
the video of the swimming echidna , which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel , was posted online by youtube user emma b .
according to australia zoo , echidnas , like many native australian animals , are actually ` proficient ' swimmers .
they like the water so much , that the zoo built a special swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days .
echidnas , like many native australian animals , are actually ` proficient ' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean .
the echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is found all over australia , in coastal forests , alpine meadows and desert habitats .
they live on a diet of ants , termites , grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus .
gary sutton , a park ranger from narawntapu national park in tasmania , said he has also seen wallabies and wombats surfing .
he previously told the abc he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites , like lice and ticks .
with its webbed-feet and snout in the air as a snorkle , the little echidna paddled out to sea .
