this is the comical moment a delirious wisdom tooth patient refuses milkshake in fear that it could - in singer kelis ' words - ` bring all the boys to her yard ' .
faith myers , 14 , from nebraska , was filmed by her mother as she woke in bed still ` high ' from the procedure 's anesthesia .
footage shows her being quizzed about what she would like to eat , with the thought of a shake clearly filling her with dread .
' i do n't want all the boys in my yard , ' she immediately chimes through a mouthful of blood-stained tissues .
` you do n't want any boys in your yard ?
will your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard ?
' her amused mother responds .
` yeah , i do n't want them here , ' faith confirms with a look of fear on her face .
the teen 's mood then takes a more sinister turn as she declares that she will ` bring out a shotgun ' if any boys come into her yard .
` bang , bang !
' she exclaims , with a look of glee in her eyes .

no boys in my yard : footage shows her being quizzed about what she would like to eat , with the thought of a shake clearly filling her with dread .
her mother then tells her to quite down .
` we 'll save milkshakes for another day , ' she adds in a bid to reduce volume levels .
after sausages are also given a thumbs down , faith and her mother finally settle on jell-o .
as the conversation continues , the dentist patient appears equally distressed about other far-fetched scenarios .
at one point she fears that she might be dying and later complains about having holes in her head .
