with arms opened wide and a slight hint of a frown , the leader of this group of raccoons seems to be warning their saviours to keep back as they are rescued after an overnight stay in a dumpster .
but the raccoon behind him is n't quite so confident , putting its paws protectively around a smaller raccoon as it inspects the human who will get them out .
these adorable photos were taken in albany , new york , after resident danique peynado went to take the rubbish out with her boyfriend .

` what took you so long ?
' the trapped - and hungry - raccoons look less than welcoming as salvation arrives .
as she opened the lid to throw the trash into the dumpster , she stopped when she saw four pairs of beseeching eyes looking up at her .
the raccoons had got themselves trapped overnight while foraging for food in the large green bin , but were not at all sure about the people who wanted to help them out .
ms peynado and her boyfriend jeff made a ramp for the notoriously shy creatures out of cardboard and retreated to give the animals the confidence to come out .
the raccoons emerged blinking in the morning sunshine and then fled , probably to the next garbage bin .
dumpsters are a popular source of food for raccoons , who tend not to think before they leap , and who are usually able to climb onto rubbish to get out once they have eaten enough .
but when the dumpster has recently been emptied , as this one had , there is nothing to climb onto - let alone eat - and the scavengers are stuck until a kind-hearted human comes and helps them out .
raccoons are shy but clever - studies have shown they learn which night trash is put out in a neighbourhood .
now how do we get down ?
the raccoons climbed up a cardboard ramp to get out of the albany dumpster .
let 's go the back way : the hungry animals worked out the best way to get down after being helped out .
