england team sponsor vauxhall were forced to apologise after breaching security by tweeting team sheets with the players ' passport numbers .
the official fifa team sheets always have the numbers alongside the names of the players , along with their date of birth , but the sensitive passport information is not for publication .
england 's team sheet , with the names of the starting line up and seven substitutes , was handed out 45 minutes before kick off against ecuador in the sun life stadium .
security breach : stan collymore tweeted a picture of the england team sheet - but it contained the players ' passport details and went viral on social media .

a vauxhall spokesman said : ` we realised we made a mistake immediately and the tweet was deleted from our account within a minute .
we have apologised to the fa for any embarrassment caused .
