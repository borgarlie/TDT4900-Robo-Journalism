on january 12 last year , she mistakenly sent a text to her boss meant for her daughter 's boyfriend who was engaged as a contact plumber for the firm .
a perth office bookkeeper was fired from her job after she called her boss ' a complete d *** ' in a text message .
in the message , ms nesbitt wrote : ` now remember ... -lsb- her employer -rsb- rob is a complete d *** ... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need .
' realising her mistake , she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents .
ms nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a ` joke within our family ' .
' i need to explain ... that message came across so wrong , ' she said .
` that is not how i feel .
my sense of humour is to exaggerate .
it is not how i feel .
` please forget it and just go on as normal .
i am very very sorry .
' ms nesbitt - who had employed at dragon mountain gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident , with her employer saying it was due to ` gross misconduct ' .
she filed a unfair dismissal complaint with the fair work commission .
while she cross examined , ms nesbitt argued the text had been taken out of context .
the commission also heard she had sent an email to her employer expressing the view she did not think he listened to her or took her counsel on board .
this had been causing tension between the two before the january 12 incident .
commissioner dj cloghan ruled against ms nesbitt .
` on the evidence , i am not persuaded that when ms nesbitt referred to mr gardner as `` a complete d *** '' , it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or , that it was `` light-hearted insult '' or it
