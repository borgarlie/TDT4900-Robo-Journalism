an icelandic man who purchased the last-ever mcdonald 's meal sold before the chain closed down in the country in 2009 was stunned when he found it did not go mouldy .
hjortur smarason , 28 , waited until the end of the fast-food chain 's last day to buy a cheeseburger together with a portion of fries .
he then donated his purchase to the national museum of iceland , where it stayed on display for three years before it was returned to him .

the mcdonald 's burger and fries bought by hjortur smarason in october 2009 - pictured in 2015 .
the burger has not gone mouldy despite spending six years on display in the national museum of iceland .
' i realised it was a historic occasion and decided to buy the last burger on sale in october 2009 , which i donated to the local museum , ' mr smarason said .
` they had it on display until somebody complained and it was decided that a museum was not the appropriate place for food on display like this .
` so they asked me for permission to destroy it .
` but i regard it as a historical item now .
i think it 's incredible that it seems to show no signs of decomposition , although apparently the fact that there were fewer chips returned to me was because some museum visitors had eaten some of them .
' the museum wanted to destroy the meal after visitors complained that it was an inappropriate exhibit .
fewer chips were returned to mr smarason because visitors had eaten some of them .
the burger spent the first three years stored in a plastic bag when it did not change at all .
in 2012 , after he took it back from the museum , it went on display at the bar of his local hotel in the capital reykjavik .
` we no longer have a mcdonald 's here , but we do have a mcdonald 's burger and it 's probably the oldest in the world , so i reckon we should n't complain too much , ' mr smarason said .
iceland is one of the only countries in the world that has no mcdonald 's .
there used to be three branches of the fast food
