new footage has emerged of a chinese toddler smoking a cigarette in the street as he is laughed at by onlookers .
the pictures are believed to be of a child aged between two and three and despite the vast numbers of adults around , not one attempts to take the cigarette away from him .
passers-by and people on bikes passing can be heard laughing as the little boy holds the cigarette , taking several puffs of it like an ` old pro ' .
the footage was obtained by liveleak.com and has sparked fresh debate about the scale of china 's tobacco habit .
it is thought that around 30 per cent of the population of china smokes , which equates to 300 million people , with as many as 53 per cent of adult men in the country smoking .
however , at the end of last year , smoking in public places such as schools and hospitals was banned in the country .
it comes after another chinese two-year-old , tong liangliang was pictured lighting up after being taught by his father , who believed the habit would alleviate pain caused by a hernia .
the child , who is thought to be between two and three years of age , was captured on camera smoking the cigarette .
several adults pass by the child in the chinese street but no one attempts to take away the cigarette .
