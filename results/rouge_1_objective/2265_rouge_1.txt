joe arpaio , who calls himself ` america 's toughest sheriff ' , and the former baywatch star appeared odd soul-mates as they joined together at the maricopa county jail on wednesday to promote the benefits of an all-vegetarian diet .
arpaio says cutting meat from the meals served to the more than 8,000 inmates has saved an estimated $ 200,000 per year .
the jail has been serving vegetarian meals for 16 months now .
