scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old .
the technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked .
the cone snail -lrb- conus geographus -rrb- uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar , leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety .
