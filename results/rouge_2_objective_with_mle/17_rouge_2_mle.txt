lisa williams , 49 , hit taxi driver david coleman three times after finding the 54-year-old brawling with her brother in the street .
the two families had been ` neighbours at war ' since the colemans moved in next door to the williams family on st catherine 's road , chingford , in 2007 .
the court heard that william 's sibling jonathan had smeared mud all over the coleman 's front bay windows .
