the two chimpanzees , living in a lab at stony brook university , are the first animals in history to be covered by a writ of habeas corpus , allowing their detention to be challenged .
the lawsuits were originally filed by the nonhuman rights project in december 2013 , in an attempt to free hercules and leo and two other chimpanzees living on private property .
